										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi Everyone! I am currently in my first year in my Data Science Masters degree program at Columbia University in New York City. My research and project work have allowed me to develop a passion in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am excited to keep building my knowledge in these fields and to ultimately use technology to make my community a better place. </p>
										<p>Aside from my Data Science interests, I am an avid basketball player, skiier, and traveler. I reside in New Hampshire, so every winter is an exciting skiing adventure as I visit the mountains in Vermont and New Hampshire. I am also a huge Boston Celtics fan and attend games at the TD Garden every season. I also participate in my university's annual Intermural basketball tournament. </p>

									<p>Throughout my undergraduate journey I have participated in various research and internship projects. Feel free to read about my work below.</p>

											<h5 class="major">A Prognostic Ensembling Machine Learning Framework</h5>
											<p>Contributed to building a machine learning ensembling algorithm which predicts future behavioral outcomes for childhood cancer survivors. These predictions were used to potentially  aid medical specialists to create alternate treatments to prevent adverse behavioral outcomes for the cancer survivors. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Covid-19 Time Series Anomaly Detection</h3>
											<p> In the midst of Covid-19, the evolving Covid-19 mutations have been deadly. This research was conducted to see if Covid-19 symptom resolution data can be used to predict mutations before they happen. The methodology was to see a spike in Anomalies during the time the mutation was actually reported. An enhanced PCA LSTM Autoencoder was the novel approach to this problem and outperformed all the other baseline models. The paper publication for this research is coming soon. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Aerial Image Processing</h3>
											<p>Parachute location tracking can be a difficult task. GPS tracking can be risky because opponents can cause signal interfence and jam the signals. In this project, we look to perform semantic segmentation to classify the pixels in the image. Once the pixels are classified, a neural network will be trained to predict the change in location between two Class Pixel matrices.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Predicting Academic Performance</h3>
											<p>In this paper we fit models for the prediction of academic outcomes and identified their potential concerns and shortcomings. For the Student Performance Data Set we found that both Linear Regression
												and Random Forest are seemingly ineffective for meaningful prediction on Math data, while Random
												Forest is the most effective on Language data. Further, we identified that Principal Component Analysis did not provide any tangible benefit over the use of the raw data.

											<h3 class="major">25Live Interactive Calendar and Map</h3>
											<p>My team and I created this project as a part of our data visualization course. We created an interactive Calendar Map using 25live data from our university which shows the events on each campus building. The visualization showed a Calendar heatmap with colors based on the density events on a given day. There is also a corresponding heatmap on the campus buildings. This interactive map is supposed to make student's lives easier to find events on campus.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Email Text Classification App</h3>
											<p>During my internship at Fidelity Investments (FCAT), I worked on a email text classification problem. There was a large class imbalance issue, so I applied some random sampling methods to try to resolve the issue. There were around 30 classes in the dataset. I then created a front end and back end using Flask/HTML. The user interface allowed the User to enter various inputs (such as Embedding/TF-IDF vector, etc.) to train the classifier and they could view the Class Distribution using T-SNE dimension reduction, and various other plots/charts.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Movie Review Text Classification</h3>
											<p>Obtained a set of Movie Reviews which was classified as Spam and Not spam. I used a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the data and also trained various classifiers, but the MLP sklearn neural network performed the best on this dataset. We also used this trained model to predict on Spotify tweets which we stored on MongoDB. </p>
